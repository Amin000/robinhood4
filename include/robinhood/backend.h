/**
 * For some backends, pinpointing exactly why an operation failed may be a quite
 * difficult task. In order to facilitate the development of new backends, the
 * following error handling mechanism is implemented:
 *
 * When a backend fails to handle an error properly, that is: set errno to a
 * documented value; it should set errno to \c RBH_BACKEND_ERROR and place an
 * explanation message in \c rbh_backend_error. This message should at best
 * explain what kind of error happened, at worst ask for forgiveness to users.
 *
 * Users! Application writers! It is your responsability to report to backend
 * maintainers when such an error occurs so that they may try their best to
 * come up with an updated error interface that allows you to gracefully handle
 * the error.
 */

/**
 * Calls to a backend's methods may set errno to \c RBH_BACKEND_ERROR if they
 * are unable to clearly identify (and document) the cause of an error.
 * In this case, they must also write a short (< 512 bytes) message in the
 * thread-local variable \c rbh_backend_error.
